# npm-registry-browser

There are lots of great resources on React out there. What might be missing is some projects mixing real world constraints like:

* API calls
* using external libraries (UI kits, http clients ...)
* some routing and global state management
* code quality good practices (linting, testing, git hooks, cis ...)

The goal of this project is to provide an example of all those things combined (which sometimes can be the part we have a hard time to put together).

## Infos

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The whole README from `create-react-app` is available [here](README.cra.md).

I took some notes along the way, they are available [here](NOTES.md)
